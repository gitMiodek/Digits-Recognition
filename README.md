# Deep learning project
## This project focuses on predicting the digit based on images of hand-written digits
Main purpose of this project:
1. Train building NN and using it to predict labels in classification problem
2. Evaluate standard metrics plots

What can be done to improve the project:
1. Solve the problem using Convutional Neural Network
> This will be my main focus on the next project from Computer Vision!
